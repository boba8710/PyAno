# PyAno
See the script code for some documentation. Some of the functions might not be in those docs, so 
there might be other functionality that's missing cause I forgot to include it. 
Also included is a python dict full of all the keynames and frequencies of piano keys. 
If this script is of use to nobody, hopefully someone can just copy/paste the dict I made instead of having to do it 
all manually like I did :\                           

Requires:: numpy, and the audiere installer in the repo. To install numpy, do:

pip install numpy            

from the command line
